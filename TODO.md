### Features
- [ ] User invitation system: Send email with secure link when admin creates user (currently shows password in modal) - **USE BREVO**
- [ ] Polling on the events page to do a "real time" statistics. The tenant users would be able to see updated data in the event statistics page. The two ideas for this would be to do a update button or do a polling every X seconds. Or maybe do both.
- [ ] The refresh control of the event statistics page make it in a component.
- [ ] Improve the UX/UI on the events depending on the status. If an event is live now we should show the update and polling information. If the event is draft or not started we should not show the View stats button.
- [ ] Email notifications system, this would be used for campaigns. The tenant will be able to create an offer and send a campaign to the users with previous filtering. Example "A campaing that is created to buy the presales ticket with a bracalet and we charge you 10 euros more if you buy today" send a great designed email for the users selected.  - **Brevo tool**
- [ ] Export reports (PDF/Excel) for payments and events
- [ ] Multi-language support in backend (currently only frontend has i18n)
- [ ] Webhook system for external integrations
- [ ] Analytics dashboard with charts (recharts or chart.js)
- [ ] QR code generation for events. The QR code will be for the payments as same as if the user has the bracelet. This would be need to be integrated with django so the QR has the bracelet id.
- [ ] Loyalty/rewards program
- [ ] Gamification
- [ ] Mobile responsive improvements in the FRONTEND
- [ ] Logging infrastructure (winston or pino) in the API
- [ ] API rate limiting (express-rate-limit)

### Mobile app
- [ ] Start the mobile app

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests (Jest/Vitest)
- [ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] E2E tests for critical flows (Playwright)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Database migration strategy documentation
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting (Sentry for errors)
- [ ] Performance optimization (caching with Redis)

### DevOps
- [ ] Docker containerization (Dockerfile + docker-compose)
- [ ] Production deployment setup (VPS/Cloud). We would use Hetzner service.
- [ ] Backup strategy for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Environment configuration management
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS setup
- [ ] Database connection pooling

---

## üìö Documentation Needed

- [ ] API documentation (Swagger UI)
- [ ] Setup/installation guide
- [ ] Architecture documentation (with diagrams)
- [ ] User manual for dashboard
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] Database schema documentation

## üí° Ideas / Future Considerations

- Integration with payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal)
- Social media sharing for events
- Customer feedback system
- Real-time notifications (Socket.io)
- Mobile app development (React Native/Expo)
- Advanced analytics with ML predictions
- Guest list management
- Ticket scanning system

---

## üêõ Known Issues

- User creation shows plain password in modal (needs email invitation system)
- No pagination on list endpoints (may cause performance issues with large datasets)
- No API rate limiting (vulnerable to abuse)
- Missing request validation on some endpoints

---

## üìù Notes

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js 20+, Express, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, bcryptjs, JWT, Zod
- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, react-router-dom, i18next
- **Mobile**: Expo, React Native (basic structure in /app)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM

### Architecture
- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (SUPERADMIN, TENANT_ADMIN, TENANT_STAFF, END_USER)
- RESTful API design

### Email Provider
- **Brevo** (formerly Sendinblue) will be used for email notifications
